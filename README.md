# Overview

I am trying to learn new skills related to game development and how to connect them to databases and websites.

You play the game by using the arrow keys to direct your ship to collect all the stars.

I wrote this software because I wanted to experiment creating a game using the arcade library.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

Made in Visual Studio Code.

Used python, and the arcade and random libraries.

# Useful Websites

* [Python Arcade 2.6.16](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/examples/index.html)
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

# Future Work

* Asteriod that you can crash into
* Highscore chart
* Two player mode
